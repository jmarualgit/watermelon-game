Setting up the start of my first game! I will base it off of [RyiSnow's basic 2D Java Game tutorial](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_QPQmz5C6WUF-pOQDsbsKbaBZqXj4qSq&si=SIBaFGlA1kHp2_1q) with some tweaks. This first commit will just be of the basic window and a game loop. As can be seen in future commits, one of the biggest changes I'll make to the tutorial is practicing encapsulation. Along with the first commits will be all the textures I so far have made which includes grass, stone, tree, water, and a left&right version of the main character. I chose to do pixel art as I have little to no artistic talent and pixel art has an arguably smaller starting learning curve.

For the most part, I have the timer set up the same way as RyiSnow, with the sleep method. I could not find a way that would make me understand it more or a way that I personally saw fit. I am a beginner after all.

Commits 4 and 5 relate to documentation file errors and submitting the wrong file.

#### Commit #3
Not having a reason to manually set the values of upPressed, downPressed, etc. is another reason as to hide them and practice more encapsulation. I set up getters instead of having the variables public.
